            <p>MM Blogs is a website which will let you submit a blog close to you and show it to the world</p>
            <p>n mid-February of 2020, I took a trip alone to the desert. It was the first and only vacation I’d taken
                by myself in my entire 47 years on this planet. I am the mother of three teenagers and an elderly dog.
                I’m also married to a man who loves solitude, and he thought that I would love it too, so he encouraged
                me to go away for a week. I don’t do well by myself, and I’m terrible at relaxing, but I managed. I took
                the week off work and social media and taught myself how to be alone. I also read more than I had in a
                long time.</p>
